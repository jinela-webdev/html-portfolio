<h3>Three Idiots</h3>
<p>I love the story plus the characters in this movie. This is a 3-hour long movie and I've watched it twice already</p>
<h3>Inside Out</h3>
<p>This movie tackles emotions living inside a person's brain in a somewhat human form and controlling how people react to things. </p>
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>Just love how this was created</p>
